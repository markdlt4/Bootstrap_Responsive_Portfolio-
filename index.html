                My name is Mark Toups, I'm originally from South Louisiana. Upon High School graduation, I enlisted into the United States Army as a Cav Scout. Not long after training I was deployed to Iraq, where I served the next 15 months. After returning home I finished my active duty contract and decide to leave the military and enrolled in school. While I was in school I began to work part time as a bartender. I quickly fell in love with food and beverage, particularly cooking so much I decided to go to culinary school. I graduated culinary school and started cooking. After years of climbing the ranks in kitchens and perfecting my craft I began to challenge myself more and created my first business while holding a full time position as Executive Chef for a restaurant group. While creating my business, I took a liking to the creation of the digital side of things. I really enjoyed working with developers and desgining the website etc. In March of 2019 I sold the company Id created and set my eyes on possibly leaving Food and Beverage as a whole and trying to take on tech. Fast forward to 2020, Covid-19 rolled in and that was the sign I needed. In March of 2020 I officially resigned from my position and enrolled at The University of Texas to learn how to code.
